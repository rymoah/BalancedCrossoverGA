PARAMETERS USED IN GA EXPERIMENTS
=================================

- population size: 50
- tournament size: 3
- mutation probability: 0.7 and 0.9 for balanced nonlinear Boolean functions
  and bent Boolean functions problems, 0.2 for OA problem
- number of experimental runs: 50
- fitness evaluations per run: 500000

The choice for this particular parameters (especially for mutation
probability) is motivated by the need of comparing our results with those
reported in the papers below:
